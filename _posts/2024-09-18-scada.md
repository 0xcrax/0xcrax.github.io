<font color="#00b050">Shodan.io is a search engine for the Internet of Things.</font>
Ever wondered how you can find publicly accessible CCTV cameras? What about finding out how many <font color="#9bbb59">Pi-Holes</font> are publicly accessible?
is your coffee machine publicly accessible? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<font color="#9bbb59">Shodan.io is the answer!</font>

<font color="#ffc000">Shodan scans the whole internet and indexes the services run on each IP address.</font>

we can learn several things related to our search(if be Domain), such as:
- IP address
- hosting company
- geographic location
- server type and version

#### Some Fun Examples : 

Which uses optical character recognition and remote desktop to <font color="#de7802">find machines compromised by ransomware on the internet.</font>
```console
has_screenshot:true encrypted attention
```

```console
encrypted
```

ICS  and we can Discover Another Scada:
```console

## Shodan Extension

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shodan/jjalcfnidlmpjhdfepjhjbhnhkbgleap

I imagine this is a good extension for any people interested in bug bounties, being quickly able to tell if a system looks vulnerable or not based on the Shodan output.

## Finding services

Let’s say we are performing a pentest on a company, and we want to find out what services one of their servers run.

<font color="#6425d0">We need to grab their IP address</font>. We can do this using `ping`.

```sh
ping tryhackme.com
```

We can ping tryhackme.com and the ping response will tell us their IP address.

<font color="#6425d0">Then once we do this, we put the IP address into Shodan to get</font>

![[aem762oz.bmp]]

We can see that TryHackMe runs on <font color="#6425d0">Cloudflare</font> in the United States and they have many ports open.
<font color="#245bdb">Cloudflare acts as a proxy between TryHackMe and their real servers.</font>

if we were pentesting a large company, this isn’t helpful. We need some way to get their IP addresses.

We can do this using <font color="#245bdb">Autonomous System Numbers(ASN)</font>

If you are an enormous company like <font color="#245bdb">Google</font> <font color="#ffc000">you will likely have your own ASN for all of the IP addresses you own.</font>

Which tells us they have the ASN <font color="#245bdb">AS14061</font> in this case.

Tryhackme isn’t a mega large corporation, so they don’t own their own ASN. When we google AS14061 we can see it is a<font color="#245bdb"> DigitalOcean Organizations ASN number</font>.

On Shodan.io,we can search using the ASN filter :

```console
ASN:[NUMBER]
```
in this case:

```console
ASN:AS14061
```
OR with engine search such google :

```console
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=asn%3AAS14061
```

![[Pasted image 20240827040216.png]]
Doing this, <font color="#de7802">we can see a whole range 7.8 million websites, in fact) that are on this one single ASN!</font>

Knowing the<font color="#245bdb"> ASN is helpful</font>, because we can search Shodan for things such as <font color="#7030a0">coffee makers</font> or <font color="#7030a0">vulnerable computers</font>  or <font color="#7030a0">webcam</font> <font color="#646a73">and more</font> within our ASN, which we know (if we are a large company) is on our network.

hostname
```console
hostname:ju.edu.jo
```

Find in hosts

```console
https://www.shodan.io/host/87.236.235.122
```
We can put the IP address into an ASN lookup tool such as
https://asnlookup.com/
https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/
https://mxtoolbox.com/asn.aspx
https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx => for multi things 
OR with shodan direct

___
## Banners

Devices run services, and Shodan stores information about them. The information is stored in a _banner_. It’s the most fundamental part of Shodan.

```python
import shodan

# Initialize the API
api = shodan.Shodan('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Search for a specific banner
results = api.search('"Welcome to nginx!"')

# Print the results
for result in results['matches']:
    print(f"IP: {result['ip_str']}, Banner: {result['data']}")
```

Another example, using the Shodan Python API, you can retrieve banner information for a specific IP like this :

```python
# Make sure your script is named something like 'my_shodan_script.py' 
import shodan

api = shodan.Shodan('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Lookup the banner for a specific IP
host = api.host('46.252.132.235')

print(host['data'])

```


<font color="#de7802">If it happened error</font> renaming the script and cleaning up the cache, run your script again to see if the issue is resolved.

```sh
rm -rf __pycache__
```


**Advanced Queries**: You can also use more advanced queries to filter results by port, country, or device type. For example:

```console
port:80 "Server: Microsoft-IIS"
```

<font color="#de7802">The Datapedia describes</font> all the metadata that Shodan crawlers gather. It is the reference document for <font color="#de7802">all information about top-level properties that are available on the banner.</font>

These top-level <font color="#6425d0">properties</font> contain<font color="#6425d0"> service-specific information</font> that provide deeper insights into the configuration and deployment <font color="#6425d0">of a device</font>

There are 2 APIs for accessing Shodan:

- **<font color="#de7802">The REST API</font>:** provides methods to search Shodan, look up hosts, get summary information on queries and a variety of utility methods to make developing easier.
- **<font color="#de7802">The Streaming API</font>:** provides a raw, real-time feed of the data that Shodan is currently collecting. There are several feeds that can be subscribed to, but the data can't be searched or otherwise interacted with; it's a live feed of data meant for large-scale consumption of Shodan's information.

## Shodan Monitor

###### The interesting part is that <font color="#00b0f0">you can actually monitor other peoples networks using this. For bug bounties</font> you can save a list of IPs and Shodan will email you if it finds any problems.

  ###### Note: This is a premium product, but you can often get $1 Shodan accounts on their Black Friday deals.
  
Shodan Monitor is an application for monitoring your devices in your own network. In their words:

 Keep track of the devices that you have exposed to the Internet. Setup notifications, launch scans and gain complete visibility into what you have connected.

Previously we had to do this using their API, but now we have this fancy application.

Access the dashboard via this link:

[https://monitor.shodan.io/dashboard](https://monitor.shodan.io/dashboard)

You’ll see it’s asking for an IP range.

![](https://skerritt.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-3.png)

Once we add a network, we can see it in our dashboard.

![](https://skerritt.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-4.png)

If we click on the settings cog, we can see that we have a range of “scans” Shodan performs against our network.

![](https://skerritt.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-5.png)

Anytime Shodan detects a security vulnerability in one of these categories, it will email us.

If we go to the dashboard again we can see it lays some things out for us.

![](https://skerritt.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-6.png)

Most notably:

- Top Open Ports (most common)
- Top Vulnerabilities (stuff we need to deal with right away)
- Notable Ports (unusual ports that are open)
- Potential Vulnerabilities
- Notable IPs (things we should investigate in more depth).

## Mastering Shodan Search Engine

BY https://ott3rly.com/

Let’s explore the depths of Shodan Dorking to level up your security testing. While Google can find many websites, Shodan lets you find everything else – servers, webcams, washing machines, etc. Imagine that you are a bad guy. It could be a true gold mine! But of course, I do not endorse anything illegal! The main thing that I’m trying to teach – is the methods to get some good leads, to find something that it’s critical for certain organizations. Report those findings and might get some reward or recognition AKA Bounties.

Watch this video in case you are too lazy to read 😊

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhxajMabyX0&ab_channel=Ott3rly

### Preparation

I’ve been doing recon on the [Coca-Cola Company](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/tccc/coca-cola/detail). Even before deep diving into the Shodan, I highly suggest gathering some information about the company. One of the prerequisites is getting the company name. You could either get it via services like [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), visiting the main website and inspecting the certificate, or just checking the footer of the main page. For this particular session, I will use “the Coca-Cola Company” as the organization name.

### Basic keywords

The first keyword I like to use while doing Shodan Dorking is **org** with the company name. It is very helpful when testing for large companies or organizations. For this instance, the Coca-Cola Shodan dork will look like this:

```console
org:"Coca-Cola Company"
```

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-1-1024x521.png)

Note: Even if you find some results, it doesn’t mean that it will actually belong to the company. Every time before you do something to the target, you have to validate.

In this case, there are only 71 results to work on, so I suggest trying the next Shodan Dork – **ssl**:

```console
ssl:"Coca-Cola Company"
```

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-2-1024x521.png)

If you want to exclude results with **403** or **400**, you could use **200** to get like less results:

```console
ssl:"Coca-Cola Company" 200
```

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-3-1-1024x521.png)

Alternatively, for SSL check you could try using `ssl.cert.subject.CN:"target.com"` dork, where **target.com** is your target’s root domain. For this specific case, the Shodan query for the main subdomain will look like this:

```console
ssl.cert.subject.CN:"coca-cola.com"
```

### Filtering Results

If you are getting thousands of results, your next goal is just to filter them out to only leave those that are interesting. I usually click on **More…** near **TOP COUNTRIES** or **TOP PORTS**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-4-1024x751.png)

You will be redirected to the page, where you can basically filter out the results. For example, by the port:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-5-1024x477.png)

Another interesting filter is **http.title**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-6-1024x477.png)

### Favicon Searches

Another interesting thing that you can also do – is search by favicon. If you have noticed Coca-Cola has its own favicon. When you have a lot of results, you can click on the icon itself and it will appear at the end of the query with **http.favicon.hash<hash**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-7-1024x571.png)

Later you could remove other filters, and check if you can enumerate more results just by using this hash. Another way to find this favicon hash is just from the main website by using extensions like [fav-up](https://github.com/pielco11/fav-up).

It’s pretty useful for Bug Bounty. There are some extra searches like – by the header. For example, checking for Jenkins – **html:”Dashboard Jenkins” http.component:”jenkins”**. This keyword checks in the HTML. Not all of Shodan dork repos on GitHub are useful since not all of those are made for bug bounties, but this repository is extremely helpful.

The next thing that I also use is checking for [Shodan favicon hashes](https://github.com/sansatart/scrapts/blob/master/shodan-favicon-hashes.csv):

Certain products, like Jenkins, has their like the same hash everywhere. Atlassian has its own hash and sometimes even multiple different ones.

Lastly, my favorite way to get ideas for Shodan Dorking is from Twitter. I use Google for this – `site:twitter shodan dorks`:

## SCADA Systems with Shodan

 SCADA Hacking: Find Vulnerable SCADA Systems with Shodan

```

As you know, Shodan just scans the IP addresses around the world and then shows us the banners. We can then query through Shodan the parameters revealed in these banners to find IP addresses of a specific type of device.

In this guide, we will look for SCADA devices. SCADA or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition are systems used for things like power transmission systems, nuclear plants, chemical plants, water treatment plants, HVAC systems, home heating, etc. All of these systems have digital controls, all of which are vulnerable to attack.

SCADA systems are a huge concern for national defense agencies, as a nation that has had its SCADA systems hacked will be left behind in the event of war. This is why organizations like US Homeland Security are so concerned about SCADA security. Most cyber warfare experts expect that all future wars will have a SCADA cyber attack component.
